## Mince Programming Language  


### Examples

Here is a example of a mince script


![example](./screenshots/example.png)


### FILES & DIRECTORIES
- the directory [editor](./editor) is where the all editor support will be stored.
- the directory [examples](./examples) is where all examples are stored.
- the directory [mcs](./mcs) or I call it 'mince extensions' will soon contain extensions for mince.
- the file [mince.py](./mince.py) is language itself.

### INSTALLATION
- to install the editor support files use the custom [make](./editor/make) script in the editor directory


### NEW
- added [sedit](https://github.com/nathan-the-coder/sedit) - the editor i've made specifically for my language.

### REVAMPED
- new name and syntax for this language. (2 times revamped)

### REMOVED
- removed server support, git integration, user input.

### Notes
- The 'print!' and 'println!' function is like rust's print functions.
- Currently I wasn't able to implement function parameters because its hard to code :).

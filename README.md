EXAMPLE:

Implementation
  Default: [Python](https://python.org)


Implemented:
  - Web Server (PS: You still need to for now manually create a style.css, edit the index.html
  and also manually create the main.js :) )
  - INPUT function

### NEW
  - added [setup.py](./setup.py) to install additional modules and the python script itself.
  - added [log.py](./scripts/log.py) - used for pretty printing error's, warning's and to print msg.
  - added [shop.py](./scripts/shop.py) - used to run shell commands in python and used in [setup.py](./setup.py). 
  - fixes the server functions to work properly


## Disclaimer
  - When running a server you need to be on the directory where the server.ql or something resides, so that it will not generate some files in the directory your not suppose to be using for your website.

### Examples

Here is a example of a mince script

### FILES & DIRECTORIES
1. the directory [editor](./editor) is where the all editor support will be stored.
2. the directory [examples](./examples) is where all examples are stored.
3. the directory [mcs](./mcs) or I call it 'mince extensions' will soon contain extensions for mince.
4. the file [mince.py](./mince.py) is language itself.


### NEW
3. added [sedit](https://github.com/nathan-the-coder/sedit) - the editor i've made specifically for my language.

### REVAMPED
1. new name and syntax for this language. (2 times revamped)

### REMOVED
1. removed server support, git integration, user input.

### Notes
2. The 'print!' and 'println!' function is like rust's print functions.
3. Currently I wasn't able to implement function parameters because its hard to code :).
